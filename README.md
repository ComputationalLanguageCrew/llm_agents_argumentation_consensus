# Consensus on LLM Agents argumentation

A simple tool based on Langchain and LLMs.

## Description

Given a starting proposition/statement in natural language (English for now) we let a number of LLM Agents argue on their agreement, disagreement or neutrality on the matter.

This tool makes it possible to calculate a collective decision via computational argumentation.
